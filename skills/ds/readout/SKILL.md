When to use:
- You need an executive-ready experiment readout.

Inputs:
- Results summary, metrics, and any validity checks performed.

Output:

2) Metrics table (primary + guardrails) + interpretation
3) Validity checks (SRM, pre-trends, logging, novelty/seasonality)
4) Heterogeneity (label exploratory vs pre-registered)
5) Risks + next iteration
Keep it concise and decision-oriented.
