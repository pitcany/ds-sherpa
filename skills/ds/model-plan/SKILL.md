description: Practical modeling plan: baselines, features, eval, deployment constraints.
---

When to use:
- You need a practical modeling plan from definition to deployment.

Inputs:
- Target definition, product constraints, data sources.

Output:
- Target definition + leakage checklist
- Baselines first (simple + strong)
- Feature sources + availability at inference time
- Offline evaluation protocol and rationale
- Error analysis plan + slice metrics
- Deployment constraints + latency/throughput
- Retraining strategy (signals, cadence, monitoring)
- End with a two-week execution plan
