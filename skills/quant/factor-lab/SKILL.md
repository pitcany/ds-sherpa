description: Factor research playbook: signal definition, IC, decay, turnover, costs.
---

When to use:
- You need a factor research plan.

Inputs:
- Signal hypothesis, universe, and data availability.

Output:
- Signal definition (math + units) and expected direction
- Data requirements (universe, survivorship, corporate actions)
- Neutralization plan (beta/sector/size)
- Evaluation: IC/RankIC, t-stats, decay, turnover, capacity
- Backtest design: rebalance, costs, constraints, slippage
- Robustness: subperiods, regime, crowding, multiple testing
- Return a research checklist + minimal backtest plan
